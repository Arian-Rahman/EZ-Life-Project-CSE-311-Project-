          <p >
            This company was founded by us , two friends named MD Arian Rahman and MD Ashiqur Rahman Ovi in our second year of earning a BSc degree in Computer Science from North South University .
          </p>
          <p >
           This project is an idea that just came into owr mind while we were stuck outside of our room
           while the keys remained inside . So after two hours of calling every living being we knew and finally finding a locksmith
           , we though , if we have services that bring food to our door step, how come there is none that can help us with emergency situations like this ?!
           This unpleasent incident gave birth to this idea of making this service possible for the ones in  need
